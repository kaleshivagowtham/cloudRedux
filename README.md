# CLoudRedux Assignment

I is built using NextJs for Front-end, NodeJS for backend and MongoDb for the daabase.

## Downloads to run the project

- Front-end
```
yarn add react-redux
yarn add cors 
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```
- (Server)Back-end
```
npm i mongoose
npm i cors
```

## Run Front-end
```
yarn dev
```

## Run Server(Back-end)
```
yarn dev
```

## Chanllenges faced
- Looping of useEffect and useMemo
- lack of updating speed of MongoDb

## what i would have implement if i had more time
- JWT authentication
- Session management
- Responsiveness
- more engaging ui/ux
